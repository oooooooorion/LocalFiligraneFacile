## Important Security & Usage Notice

*   **Privacy:** Your privacy is paramount. All processing is done locally in your browser, and no files are sent to any server.
*   **User Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for how this watermarked image is used and the watermark text you choose.
*   **Do Not Reuse:** Each watermarked image generated by this tool is unique to that specific watermarking action. **Never reuse the same watermarked image for different purposes**, as this can potentially be traced back to a single instance of sharing and compromise your privacy.
