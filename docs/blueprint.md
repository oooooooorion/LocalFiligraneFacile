# **App Name**: IdMark

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Accept an image file representing an ID document from the user's device. Support file standards such as pdf (in all forms and variety, even if it has to reformat the pdf files), png, jpg or other formats.
- Watermark Customization: Allow the user to enter custom text to use as a watermark.
- Watermark Application: Superimpose the watermark text onto the uploaded image within the browser. The watermark should cover all of the image, but still be subtle with transparency.
- Image Download: Allow the user to download the watermarked image as a new file, without sending the file to a server.
- Local Processing: Handle file uploads, image processing and downloads all client-side, to guarantee privacy and security. Warn the user that they are soley responsible for how the image is used and the selected watermark. Remind the user never to reuse the same image more than once as each watermarked image constitutes unique identification of a single instance.
